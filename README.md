### Summary:
This simple inventory management system (IMS) is a basic CRUD application that stores Part and Product objects. Products are made from Parts contained within the IMS and have constraints placed on removing them from the system only if all of their associated Parts have first been removed. The application features search bars that allow the user to filter each list of Parts or Products by name or ID.
